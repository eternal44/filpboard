## Recreate the ['Flipboard' app](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-seyrq/0/1) from CodeCademy's site.

## Installation
After cloning the site 'cd' into the app root and install these dependencies.  I'm assuming you
already have 'gem' & 'npm'.


Install SASS & http-server
```bash
gem install sass
npm install http-server -g
```

## Configure
Precompile SCSS & start up the server if you want to fiddle with the
code:
```bash
sass --watch input.scss:output.css
http-server
```

## View
Point your browser to 'localhost:8080' to view the page
